# Registration Management System (RMS) using Java

Designed and implemented a back-end system responsible for managing the list of participants. 
The RMS offers a set of possible commands through which it interacts with the user to process 
the input data and execute the corresponding functionality.

The application consists of 3 component parts:
1.	"Guest" class - a representation of a participant;
2.	"GuestsList" class - a class that implements participant list management;
3.	"RegistrationManagementSystemApp" class - a main class, which represents the engine of the application;
